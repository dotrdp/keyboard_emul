## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Classes to Implement:
1. **IPatch** - Base class for Harmony patches
2. **KeyboardInputState** - Manages simulated keyboard state  
3. **KeybindManager** - Central manager for keybind operations
4. **ConsoleCommandHandler** - Processes console commands
5. **MacroSystem** - Records and plays back key sequences
6. **KeybindConfig** - Configuration management

### Harmony Patches Required:
1. **KeyboardDispatcher patches** - Intercept and override keyboard input
2. **SInputState patches** - Override SMAPI input state for simulated keys
3. **Game1 input patches** - Ensure compatibility with game input system

### Console Command Format:

### Manual Testing Scenarios:
- [ ] Basic key press simulation (movement, actions)
- [ ] Complex key combinations (Ctrl+C, Shift+Click)
- [ ] Macro recording of farming sequences
- [ ] Profile switching between different keybind sets
- [ ] Error handling for invalid commands

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Timing Precision
**Problem:** Ensuring accurate timing for key sequences and macros
**Solution:** Use game tick-based timing instead of real-time for consistency

### Challenge 2: State Synchronization
**Problem:** Keeping simulated key state in sync with game expectations
**Solution:** Comprehensive SInputState patches and state validation

### Challenge 3: Mod Compatibility
**Problem:** Ensuring compatibility with other input-modifying mods
**Solution:** Careful patch ordering and optional integration hooks

### Challenge 4: Performance Impact
**Problem:** Harmony patches could impact game performance

## ‚úÖ RECENT UPDATES - July 12, 2025

### üîß KeyboardState Warning Resolution
- **Issue**: "Failed to create custom KeyboardState" warnings were appearing
- **Root Cause**: Complex reflection-based approach to KeyboardState creation was failing
- **Solution**: Simplified approach using multiple patch layers instead of KeyboardState manipulation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved - No more warnings, cleaner architecture

### üîß Virtual Key Detection Issues  
- **Issue**: Virtual keys set via KeybindManager.PressKey() weren't being recognized by the game
- **Root Cause**: SMAPI uses complex input handling that wasn't being properly intercepted
- **Investigation**: Created comprehensive patch system targeting multiple input layers:
  1. **InputHelper_IsDown**: Patches SMAPI's IInputHelper.IsDown method
  2. **SInputState_IsDown**: Patches SMAPI's internal input state
  3. **SMAPI_InputHelper**: Comprehensive scanning and patching of all SMAPI input methods
  4. **Game1_InputIsDown**: Direct patching of Game1.input.IsDown
  5. **KeyboardState_IsKeyDown**: XNA Framework fallback patches
- **Debugging Tools**: Added `keybind_test` command for testing virtual key recognition
- **Status**: üîÑ Under Investigation - Multiple patch layers implemented

### üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Separated Test Project**: Removed SMAPI dependencies from test project to avoid assembly conflicts
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive tracing in all patch classes
- **Modular Patches**: Each input interception method is now in separate patch classes
- **Defensive Programming**: Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### üß™ Testing Infrastructure
- **keybind_test Command**: New debugging command to verify virtual key simulation
  ```
  keybind_test W    // Test if virtual W key press works
  ```
- **Status Monitoring**: Enhanced keybind_status command for debugging
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple patch points ensure we catch all input pathways

### üìö Technical Notes
- **Harmony Patching**: Using postfix patches to override input method return values
- **SMAPI Integration**: Targeting both public and internal SMAPI input APIs
- **XNA Fallback**: Direct XNA Framework patches for games that bypass SMAPI
- **Reflection Safety**: All reflection operations wrapped in try-catch blocks

### üéØ Next Steps for Debugging
1. Test the `keybind_test` command in-game to see which patches are working
2. Monitor SMAPI console for patch application success messages
3. Use `keybind_status` to verify KeybindManager state management
4. If still not working, may need to patch even deeper into SMAPI's input pipeline

## üîß **SPAM LOGGING FIXED & CRITICAL PATCHES ADDED** 

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Logging Spam**: The console spam of "Virtual keybinds active during SMAPI GetState call" has been fixed by adding time-based throttling (only logs once per second)
2. **Critical Input Patches**: Added `CriticalInputPatch` that specifically targets SMAPI's `InputHelper.IsDown` method - this is the most likely method that needs to be patched for virtual keys to work
3. **Player Movement Patches**: Added `PlayerMovementPatch` to ensure virtual movement keys are properly recognized by the player movement system

### New Debugging Commands:
- **`keybind_direct_test W`**: Tests if SMAPI's input helper directly recognizes virtual keys
  - This will show you exactly where the virtual key detection is failing
  - Checks KeybindManager, SMAPI Helper.Input.IsDown, and Game1.input separately

### Testing Steps:
1. Try `keybind_direct_test W` to see if SMAPI sees the virtual key
2. If SMAPI sees it but movement doesn't work, the issue is in movement processing
3. If SMAPI doesn't see it, we need to patch different input methods

### Architecture Changes:
- **Time-throttled logging**: Reduced spam from every frame to once per second maximum
- **Critical patch priority**: `CriticalInputPatch` and `PlayerMovementPatch` are now applied first
- **Direct SMAPI testing**: `keybind_direct_test` directly accesses SMAPI's input helper to verify patch effectiveness
