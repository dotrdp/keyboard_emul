echo Virtual Keyboard - Minimized Game Test
echo ======================================
echo.
echo This test verifies that input simulation works even when the game is minimized.
echo.
echo INSTRUCTIONS:
echo 1. Start Stardew Valley with this mod loaded
echo 2. Minimize the game window
echo 3. Run the commands below in SMAPI console
echo 4. Check if the game responds to input while minimized
echo.
echo TEST COMMANDS:
echo move_up
echo move_down
echo move_left  
echo move_right
echo keybind_press_key W
echo keybind_press_key S
echo keybind_press_key A
echo keybind_press_key D
echo.
echo EXPECTED RESULT:
echo - All movement commands should work even when game is minimized
echo - Player character should move in the specified directions
echo - This should work because InputState.GetKeyboardState() is now patched
echo.
echo KEY TECHNICAL CHANGES:
echo - Added InputState_Patches.cs to bypass focus checks in GetKeyboardState()
echo - This is the core method that was blocking input when minimized
echo - Enhanced VirtualInputSimulator with generic key tracking (SetKeyPressed method)
echo - KeybindManager now sends keys to both VirtualInputSimulator and Windows API
echo - SInputState patches now properly inject virtual keys into keyboard state
echo - Focus override patches (HasKeyboardFocus, IsMainInstance) work together
echo - Windows API input simulation provides low-level input injection
echo - Removed problematic IsActive patch that caused build errors
echo.
