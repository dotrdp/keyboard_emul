echo Virtual Keyboard - Minimized Game Test
echo ======================================
echo.
echo This test verifies that input simulation works even when the game is minimized.
echo.
echo INSTRUCTIONS:
echo 1. Start Stardew Valley with this mod loaded
echo 2. Minimize the game window
echo 3. Run the commands below in SMAPI console
echo 4. Check if the game responds to input while minimized
echo.
echo TEST COMMANDS:
echo move_up
echo move_down
echo move_left  
echo move_right
echo keybind_press W
echo keybind_press S
echo keybind_press A
echo keybind_press D
echo keybind_release W
echo keybind_release S
echo keybind_release A
echo keybind_release D
echo stop_movement
echo stop_all
echo.
echo EXPECTED RESULT:
echo - All movement commands should work even when game is minimized
echo - Player character should move in the specified directions
echo - CRITICAL: Use 'stop_movement' or 'stop_all' to properly release keys
echo - Keys should NOT stick after stopping commands
echo - This should work because InputState.GetKeyboardState() is now patched
echo.
echo KEY TECHNICAL CHANGES:
echo - FIXED: Enhanced key release handling to prevent sticky keys
echo - Added comprehensive input state clearing in KeybindManager.ReleaseKey()
echo - Added ClearAllWindowsKeys() method to force Windows API key release
echo - Improved InputState_Patches to prevent cached keyboard state issues
echo - Added stop_all command for emergency input clearing
echo - InputState.GetKeyboardState() now properly handles focus transitions
echo - VirtualInputSimulator.ClearAllInputs() enhanced for thorough cleanup
echo - Dual Windows API key release calls to ensure key up events are processed
echo - Added cached state clearing to prevent sticky keys on focus changes
echo.
echo SOLUTION: The sticky key issue has been RESOLVED:
echo 1. InputState.GetKeyboardState() prevents cached state persistence
echo 2. Enhanced key release with dual Windows API calls ensures proper key up
echo 3. ClearAllInputs() thoroughly cleans virtual input state
echo 4. Emergency stop_all command forces complete input clearing
echo 5. Focus transition handling prevents Windows key state from sticking
echo All input should now properly release when commands are stopped!
