# VirtualKeyboard Mod - Console-Based Keybind Emulation

A powerful Stardew Valley mod that provides console-based keyboard input simulation and keybind automation. This mod has been completely refactored from its original visual interface to use a sophisticated console command system based on the TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) mod patterns.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Console-Based Control**: All functionality accessible through SMAPI console commands
- **Real-Time Key Simulation**: Simulate keyboard input that integrates seamlessly with the game
- **Advanced Timing Control**: Precise timing for key sequences, holds, and combinations
- **Macro System**: Record and playback complex key sequences
- **Zero Visual Overhead**: No on-screen UI elements, completely console-driven

### Key Simulation Capabilities
- Single key presses
- Timed key holds
- Key sequences with custom intervals
- Simultaneous key combinations (Ctrl+C, etc.)
- Repeating key patterns
- Conditional key releases

## üìã Console Commands

All commands are available through the SMAPI console (press `~` in-game).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Harmony Patches**: Intercepts and overrides keyboard input at multiple levels
- **KeyboardDispatcher Patches**: Suppresses normal input when virtual keys are active
- **SInputState Patches**: Integrates virtual keys with SMAPI's input system
- **Modular Command System**: Extensible console command architecture

### Key Components
1. **KeybindManager**: Central manager for all virtual key operations
2. **ConsoleCommandHandler**: Processes and executes console commands
3. **VirtualKeyboardState**: Manages XNA Framework keyboard state integration
4. **IPatch System**: Base class for all Harmony patches

### Performance
- Minimal performance impact when not in use
- Efficient key state tracking
- Optimized patch execution
- Memory-conscious sequence management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The mod includes a configuration file (`config.json`) with the following options:

```json
{
  "Enabled": true,
  "DefaultSequenceInterval": 100,
  "DefaultHoldDuration": 50,
  "LogKeybindOperations": true
}
```

### Configuration Options
- **Enabled**: Whether the keybind system is enabled by default
- **DefaultSequenceInterval**: Default time between sequence steps (ms)
- **DefaultHoldDuration**: Default duration for key holds (ms)
- **LogKeybindOperations**: Whether to log keybind operations for debugging

## üß™ Testing

The mod includes comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Run tests (requires test runner)
dotnet test
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for console commands
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling validation

## üîß Development

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd keyboard_emul/VirtualKeyboard
dotnet build
```

### Adding Custom Commands
1. Implement `IConsoleCommand` interface
2. Register in `ConsoleCommandHandler.Initialize()`
3. Add tests in `Tests/` directory

### Extending Functionality
The mod is designed to be extensible:
- Add new patch classes in `Patches/` directory
- Implement additional key simulation features
- Create custom macro systems

## üìù Migration from Visual Version

If you were using the previous visual button version:

1. **Remove old configuration**: The visual button configuration is now obsolete
2. **Learn console commands**: All functionality is now console-based
3. **Update workflows**: Convert button sequences to console commands

### Command Migration Examples
- **Old**: Click virtual W button ‚Üí **New**: `keybind_press W`
- **Old**: Hold virtual Space ‚Üí **New**: `keybind_hold Space 1000`
- **Old**: Button sequence ‚Üí **New**: `keybind_sequence W,A,S,D`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Keys not responding**
- Check if keybind system is enabled: `keybind_status`
- Verify key names with: `keybind_list`
- Clear stuck keys: `keybind_clear`

**Harmony patch failures**
- Check SMAPI log for patch errors
- Ensure no conflicting mods
- Restart game if patches fail to apply

**Performance issues**
- Disable logging: Set `LogKeybindOperations` to `false`
- Reduce sequence frequency
- Clear unused active sequences

### Debug Commands
```bash
keybind_status          # Check current state
keybind_enable false    # Temporarily disable
keybind_clear          # Reset all state
```

## üîß Recent Updates

### Warp Behavior Fix
**Issue**: Virtual keyboard input was stopping whenever the player warped to a new location.

**Root Cause**: The warp process calls `Farmer.Halt()` which sets `CanMove = false` and other movement-blocking properties, preventing virtual input simulation from working.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive Harmony patches that:
- Restore movement capabilities after `Farmer.Halt()` when virtual input is active
- Ensure movement properties are restored after warp completion  
- Handle all warp scenarios (farm totems, building transitions, mine levels, etc.)
- Use delayed actions to avoid timing conflicts with the warp process
- Only intervene when virtual input is active to preserve normal game behavior

**Files Modified**: `InputState_Patches.cs` - Added `Farmer_Halt_Patches`, `Farmer_WarpFarmer_Patches`, and `Farmer_OnWarp_Patches`

### Minimized Window Support  
The mod includes sophisticated patches to enable virtual input simulation even when Stardew Valley is minimized or doesn't have focus:
- Bypasses focus checks in `InputState.GetKeyboardState()`
- Forces `Game1.IsActiveNoOverlay` to return true when virtual input is active
- Maintains full functionality regardless of window state
