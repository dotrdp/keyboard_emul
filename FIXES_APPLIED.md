# Fixed Issues - Testing Guide

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### **1. Window Detection Enhanced**
- Added `EnumWindows` API to find ANY window from current process
- Fallback logic looks for "Stardew", "Valley", "SMAPI" in window titles
- More robust window handle detection

### **2. Logging Spam Eliminated**
- Movement commands now use KeybindManager instead of old VirtualInputSimulator
- Removed repeated logging in sequences and combos
- Only logs command execution, not individual key events

### **3. Unified Input System**
- All commands now use KeybindManager for consistency
- Both SMAPI patches AND Windows API work together
- Automatic Windows input for minimized game support

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Commands

### **Test Window Detection**
```bash
keybind_windows reinit    # Should now find the game window
keybind_windows status    # Should show "Initialized: True"
```

Expected Output:
```
Windows Input Status:
â€¢ KeybindManager Windows Input: True  
â€¢ Windows Input Simulator - Initialized: True, Window Handle: [number], Enabled: True
```

### **Test Movement (Clean Logging)**
```bash
move_up 1000             # Should only log once: "Moving up for 1000ms"
move_left 500            # Should only log once: "Moving left for 500ms"
stop_movement            # Should only log once: "All virtual movement stopped"
```

### **Test Minimized Support**
1. **Keep game running** (focused or minimized)
2. **Test with game focused:**
   ```bash
   move_up 2000          # Should work via SMAPI + Windows API
   ```
3. **Minimize the game** (Alt+Tab)
4. **Test with game minimized:**
   ```bash
   move_up 2000          # Should STILL work via Windows API
   keybind_press C       # Should STILL work via Windows API
   ```

## âœ… Expected Results

### **Window Detection**
- âœ… `keybind_windows status` shows `Initialized: True`
- âœ… Window handle is non-zero number
- âœ… No more "Could not find Stardew Valley window" warnings

### **Clean Logging**
- âœ… Movement commands log only once per execution
- âœ… No repeated key press/release spam
- âœ… Sequences/combos log only start/completion

### **Minimized Game Support**
- âœ… Commands work when game is focused (normal behavior)
- âœ… Commands STILL work when game is minimized (via Windows API)
- âœ… Character moves even when Stardew Valley window is not active

## ðŸŽ® Test Sequence

1. **Check window detection:**
   ```bash
   keybind_windows reinit
   keybind_windows status
   ```

2. **Test clean logging:**
   ```bash
   move_up 1000
   # Should see: "Moving up for 1000ms" (once only)
   ```

3. **Test minimized support:**
   ```bash
   # Minimize game with Alt+Tab
   move_up 3000
   # Character should STILL move even though game is minimized!
   ```

## ðŸš€ Complete Solution

Your VirtualKeyboard mod now provides:
- âœ… Robust window detection for any game window
- âœ… Clean, non-spammy console output  
- âœ… Unified KeybindManager-based input system
- âœ… True minimized game support via Windows API
- âœ… Seamless operation whether game is focused or minimized

**The mod should now work perfectly even when Stardew Valley is minimized!** ðŸŽ‰
