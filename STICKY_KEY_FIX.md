# Sticky Key Input Buffer Fix

## Problem Description
After running movement commands and stopping them, the character continued moving using the previous command. The input buffer wasn't being properly updated unless the user interacted with the game window, causing "sticky keys" where virtual input persisted even after commands were stopped.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Cached Keyboard State**: `InputState.GetKeyboardState()` caches keyboard state, and when the window regains focus, it reads stale Windows keyboard state that still shows keys as pressed.

2. **Incomplete Key Release**: The key release process wasn't thorough enough - Windows API input could persist while virtual input was cleared, creating a mismatch.

3. **Focus Transition Issues**: When switching between minimized/focused states, the cached keyboard state could contain old key presses that weren't properly cleared.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Key Release Process (`KeybindManager.ReleaseKey`)
- Added dual Windows API key release calls with a small delay
- Force clear all virtual input when no keys are held
- Added safety call to `ClearAllWindowsKeys()` when all keys are released

### 2. Improved InputState Patches
- Enhanced `InputState_GetKeyboardState_Patch` to completely bypass cached state when virtual input is active
- Added `ClearCachedKeyboardState()` method to force clear stale state during focus transitions
- Return only virtual keyboard state when `VirtualInputSimulator.Active` is true

### 3. Added Emergency Stop Commands
- `stop_all` command for immediate clearing of all virtual input
- `ReleaseAllKeys()` method that thoroughly clears all input state
- Enhanced `ClearAllInputs()` with better documentation

### 4. Windows API Key Clearing
- Added `ClearAllWindowsKeys()` method that releases all common game keys
- Covers movement, action, inventory, menu, and modifier keys
- Called as safety measure when disabling virtual input

## Key Technical Changes

### KeybindManager.cs
```csharp
// Enhanced key release with dual Windows API calls
WindowsInputSimulator.SendKeyInput(xnaKey, false);
System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run(async () => 
{
    await System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Delay(50);
    WindowsInputSimulator.SendKeyInput(xnaKey, false);
});

// Force clear all when no keys held
if (HeldKeys.Count == 0)
{
    VirtualInputSimulator.Active = false;
    VirtualInputSimulator.Instance.ClearAllInputs();
    ClearAllWindowsKeys();
}
```

### InputState_Patches.cs
```csharp
// Always return virtual state when active, ignore cached state
if (VirtualInputSimulator.Active)
{
    __result = VirtualInputSimulator.Instance.GetKeyboardState();
    return false; // Skip original method completely
}

// Clear cached state when losing focus
if (!Game1.game1.HasKeyboardFocus())
{
    ClearCachedKeyboardState();
    __result = new KeyboardState();
    return false;
}
```

## Testing Commands

After implementing these fixes, test with:

1. `keybind_press W` - Press and hold W key
2. `keybind_release W` - Release W key (should stop immediately)
3. `move_up 1000` - Move up for 1 second
4. `stop_movement` - Stop all movement
5. `stop_all` - Emergency stop all input

## Expected Behavior

- Keys should release immediately when commands are stopped
- No more sticky keys after stopping movement commands
- Character should stop moving as soon as release/stop commands are executed
- Input state should be completely cleared when transitioning focus
- Emergency `stop_all` command provides failsafe for any stuck input

## Additional Safety Measures

- Multiple layers of input clearing (VirtualInputSimulator + Windows API + cached state)
- Timeout-based key release with dual API calls
- Comprehensive key list covering all game inputs
- Focus transition handling to prevent state persistence

This fix addresses the core issue where the input buffer retained key states after commands were stopped, ensuring proper input cleanup and preventing sticky key behavior.
