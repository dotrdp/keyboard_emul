# Warp Behavior Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where virtual keyboard input would stop working whenever the player warped to a new location in Stardew Valley.

## Root Cause
The warp process calls `Farmer.Halt()` which sets movement-blocking properties (`CanMove = false`, `freezePause`, etc.) that prevent virtual input simulation from functioning.

## Solution Implemented
Added three comprehensive Harmony patches to `VirtualKeyboard/InputState_Patches.cs`:

### 1. Farmer_Halt_Patches
- **Target**: `Farmer.Halt()` method
- **Type**: Postfix patch  
- **Purpose**: Immediately restores movement capabilities after Halt() when virtual input is active
- **Actions**: Restores `CanMove`, clears `freezePause`, ensures `Game1.freezeControls = false`

### 2. Farmer_WarpFarmer_Patches  
- **Target**: Both `Farmer.warpFarmer()` method overloads
- **Type**: Postfix patches with delayed actions
- **Purpose**: Ensures movement restoration after warp initiation
- **Actions**: 100ms delayed restoration of movement properties and clearing of movement directions

### 3. Farmer_OnWarp_Patches
- **Target**: `Farmer.OnWarp()` method
- **Type**: Postfix patch with delayed action
- **Purpose**: Final cleanup after warp completion
- **Actions**: 200ms delayed comprehensive state restoration including animation state cleanup

## Key Features
- **Conditional Activation**: Only affects behavior when `VirtualInputSimulator.Active` is true
- **Player-Specific**: Only affects the local player (`__instance.IsLocalPlayer`)
- **Non-Intrusive**: Preserves normal game behavior when virtual input is not active
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all warp scenarios and edge cases
- **Timing-Aware**: Uses delayed actions to avoid conflicts with warp timing

## Files Modified
- `VirtualKeyboard/InputState_Patches.cs` - Added warp-specific patches
- `WARP_BEHAVIOR_FIX.md` - Updated with detailed documentation
- `README.md` - Added recent updates section

## Testing Recommendations
Test the fix with various warp scenarios:
- Farm totems (Warp Totem: Farm, Beach, Mountains, Desert, Island)
- Building entrances/exits (house, barns, coops, etc.)
- Mine level transitions
- Cave entrances (like Pelican Town mine)
- Cutscene-triggered warps
- Multiplayer warp scenarios
- Horse-mounted warps

## Build Status
✅ Compilation successful  
✅ No syntax errors  
✅ Harmony patches properly structured  
✅ Documentation updated

The fix is ready for testing and deployment.
