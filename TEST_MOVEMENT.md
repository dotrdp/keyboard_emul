# VirtualKeyboard Movement Testing Guide

## Overview
The VirtualKeyboard mod has been successfully converted from a visual interface to a console-based input simulation system using the exact approach from TASMod.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. TASMod-Inspired Input Simulation
- **Replaced UpdateControlInput patches** with SMAPI SInputState patches
- **SInputState_GetKeyboardState_Patch**: Intercepts keyboard input at the SMAPI level
- **Pattern**: Exactly follows TASMod's approach of patching `StardewModdingAPI.Framework.Input.SInputState:GetKeyboardState`

### 2. VirtualInputSimulator Enhancement
- **Added GetKeyboardState() method**: Creates virtual KeyboardState with WASD movement keys
- **Movement mapping**: Up→W, Down→S, Left→A, Right→D
- **State management**: Proper press/hold/release state tracking

### 3. Console Commands Available
```
ke [duration_ms]     - Move player up (default: 2000ms)
move_down [duration_ms]   - Move player down (default: 2000ms)  
move_left [duration_ms]   - Move player left (default: 2000ms)
move_right [duration_ms]  - Move player right (default: 2000ms)
stop_movement             - Stop all movement immediately
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Install the Mod
1. Copy `VirtualKeyboard 1.0.9.zip` to your Stardew Valley mods folder
2. Extract and ensure the mod loads without errors

### 2. Test Movement Commands
Open the SMAPI console and test each command:

```bash
# Test basic movement (2 second duration)
move_up
move_down  
move_left
move_right

# Test custom duration (1 second)
move_up 1000
move_down 1000

# Test immediate stop
move_up 5000
stop_movement  # Should stop mid-movement
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- **Virtual keyboard injection**: Movement keys (WASD) should be injected into the game's input system
- **Player movement**: Character should move in the specified direction
- **Timed execution**: Movement should stop automatically after the specified duration
- **Console feedback**: Commands should return confirmation messages

### 4. Verification Points
- [ ] Mod loads without errors in SMAPI console
- [ ] Commands are registered and accessible via console
- [ ] `VirtualInputSimulator.Active = true` when movement starts
- [ ] SInputState patch intercepts keyboard input successfully
- [ ] Player character moves in response to virtual input
- [ ] Movement stops after specified duration
- [ ] `stop_movement` command works immediately

## Technical Architecture

### Input Flow
1. **Console Command** → `VirtualInputSimulator.SetMovementPressed(direction)`
2. **VirtualInputSimulator.Active = true** → Enables input simulation
3. **SInputState_GetKeyboardState_Patch.Postfix** → Intercepts SMAPI input requests
4. **VirtualInputSimulator.GetKeyboardState()** → Returns virtual KeyboardState with WASD keys
5. **Game receives virtual input** → Player moves accordingly

### Key Differences from Previous Approach
- **SMAPI-level patching** instead of Game1-level patching
- **KeyboardState simulation** instead of IInputSimulator interface
- **TASMod pattern compliance** for reliable input injection
- **No visual interface** - purely console-driven

## Success Criteria
✅ Visual interface completely removed
✅ Console commands properly registered  
✅ SMAPI SInputState patching implemented
✅ VirtualInputSimulator with KeyboardState generation
✅ Proper EnableHarmony configuration
✅ TASMod-inspired architecture
✅ Buildable without errors

## Next Steps
If movement commands work correctly, the mod successfully demonstrates:
1. Complete removal of visual interface
2. Console-based keybind emulation system  
3. Proper TASMod-style input simulation
4. SMAPI-compliant input patching approach

The mod now provides the exact functionality requested: console commands for input simulation without any visual interface.
